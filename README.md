# Development: The Link Between Manufacturing Employment and GDP per Capita
This repository contains the datasets, tools for analysis, results, reproducibility package, and final report of the ECN 310 development team project.

## Abstract
We examine the link between GDP growth and manufacturing employment, hypothesizing that there is a negative relationship between manufacturing employment and GDP; As manufacturing employment decreases, GDP increases. We source statistics
from Our World in Data charts, which examine these variables in all countries around the globe.
We create a distinction between developing and developed countries, setting the threshold at USD 20.000 Annual GDP per capita. We conduct a correlation test to compare these variables across both economies. 
The research conducted supports the hypothesis that manufacturing plays a more significant role in driving economic growth in developing countries compared to developed ones. The positive correlation in developing countries underscores the critical role of industrialization in early stages of economic
growth. In contrast, the negative correlation in developed countries highlights the global transition.
