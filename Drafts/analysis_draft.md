# Project-Development Analysis Draft
## **Hypothesis Statements**

*Hypothesis:* There is a negative relationship between manufacturing employment and GDP; As manufacturing employment decreases, GDP increases.


*Null Hypothesis:* There is no relationship between manufacturing employment and GDP.

## **Findings**
1. *Correlation:*
- Developed economies show a negative correlation (r=−0.3601), demonstrating that as manufacturing employment declines, GDP tends to rise.
- Developing economies exhibit a positive correlation (r=0.284), demonstrating that manufacturing employment is positively associated with GDP growth.

2. *Regression:*
- In developed economies, the regression coefficient (−1364.327) suggests that for every unit increase in manufacturing employment, GDP decreases by approximately $1364.33 USD, demonstrating a shift away from manufacturing.
- In developing economies, the regression coefficient of (258.9044) demonstrates that for every unit increase in manufacturing employment, GDP rises by approximately $258.90 USD, showing the importance of manufacturing as a growth driver in a developing economy.

3. *T-Test:*
- A t-test comparing GDP values between developed and developing economies produced a t-statistic of 21.84 and a p-value of 9.08×10^−10, showing that the difference in GDP values between the two groups is significant (p<0.001)

## **Economic Analysis**
- *Developed Economies:* The negative relationship goes to show that advanced economies prioritize other sectors like services and technology, leading to reduced dependence on manufacturing employment for GDP growth.
- *Developing Economies:* The positive relationship sheds light on how developing countries are in earlier stages of economic development, where manufacturing drives growth by creating jobs and boosting exports.

## **Visual Representation**
### *Developed Economies:*

![Graph Mean (GDP)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/294721e8-58fd-436e-9662-cf6c4ceba1cc)
![Graph Mean (MANU)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6974fa9-aeed-484c-bfdf-1c695aa104df)
- The graphs show a steady decline in manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2020, while GDP continues to rise, illustrating the shift to service and technology sectors.

### *Developing Economies:*

![Graph Mean GDP (no 2020   2023) ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a362a6-6ce6-4b55-997c-a094ce5dfbc2)
![Graph Mean Manufacturing (no 2020   2023)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/667de9be-6efa-406e-823e-0ce27fa66208)
- The graphs show both manufacturing employment and GDP rising over time, highlighting manufacturing’s importance in driving economic growth.

## **Implications**
1. *Policy Recommendations:*
- Developed economies should continue to invest in innovation and technology to maintain their GDP growth trajectory.
- Developing economies should focus on policies that support industrialization, including investment in education and technology to sustain manufacturing-driven growth.
- The results emphasize the potential demand for country-specific policies based on the stage of economic development.

**Limitations**
1. *Data Quality:*
- The analysis relies on aggregated data, which may mask regional variations within countries.
- The 2020 data, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, introduces potential bias due to disruptions in labor markets; The graphs exclude this outlier

2. *Low R-Squared in Developed Economies:*
- The regression model for developed economies has a relatively low R-squared (0.129), showing that other factors such as growth in the service sector play significant roles in GDP changes.

3. *Graph Issues:*
- Significant time was spent attempting to properly label the axes on the graphs, but technical difficulties with the software prevented this.
- To resolve this, I plan to use Photoshop to manually label the axes later this morning.
- The time frame for developed economies (2000–2020) and developing economies (1990–2020) varies, potentially affecting the consistency of the analysis. 
- The scales of the graphs for manufacturing and GDP differ, which may make it harder to directly compare trends between the two variables; Will discuss with group members who created .do files later this morning.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights significant differences in the relationship between manufacturing and GDP across developed and developing economies. The negative correlation in developed economies reflects a shift away from manufacturing toward service and technology sectors, while the positive correlation in developing economies underscores the importance of manufacturing as a growth driver. These findings align with global economic theories of structural change and emphasize the need for potential policies based on a country's stage of development.
