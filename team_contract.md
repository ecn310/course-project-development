> [!IMPORTANT]
> All team members must follow these guidelines at all times


## A. Temporal

1. All group members will be present weekly, on Wednesday evenings, at Ernie Davis hall, 8th floor study lounge
2. All group members will be punctual, and meetings will start 5 minutes after the designated time
3. Whenever a team member believes they cannot make it, they should make all efforts to let the team know 24 hours in advance, so the team can reschedule for the week
4. All team members will remain at the meeting until all issues have been discussed, work is complete, or there is unanimous agreement to end the meeting
5. Breaks will be decided unanimously during meetings. They should not exceed than 30 minutes

## B. Procedural

The team will keep an active log reporting team members' activity during meetings, and any accomplishments or shortcomings.
All group members are to come prepared to meetings, and curate any ideas they wish to present to the group


## C. Methods for Resolving an Impasse

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the following measures are fully enforceable by  Prof. Buzard and the class TA

-  __Step 1__: All team members will hold each other accountable for tasks and we will have a designated person that will send out deadline reminders, so that no team member can say that they weren't aware of when to submit their work.
-  __Step 2__: All team members will have three strikes, if not communicated within 24 hours of the deadline, in terms of getting their work done on time.
   If a team member repeatedly fails to complete their work, misses deadlines, or is not participating equally, the following warning system will be implemented:

   -  Strike 1: Verbal Warning: After the first missed deadline or instance of inadequate participation, the Leader will issue a verbal warning to the group member, reminding them of their responsibilities and the impact of their actions on the team’s progress.
   -  Strike 2: Written Warning: If the issue persists, the Historian will document the incident, and a written warning will be sent to the individual. This warning will clearly state the specific expectations they have not met and a deadline by which the behavior needs to improve.
   -  Strike 3: Group Meeting with the Member: If no improvement is observed after the second strike, the group will hold a meeting with the individual to directly address the ongoing issues. This meeting should focus on finding solutions, such as re- allocating tasks or offering support.

- __Step 3__: If Step 1 is not met by all team members then the TA will be contacted and informed about the situation. 
- __Step 4__: If the individual's behavior does not change, the issue will be taken directly to Professor Buzard and a grade change will be determined. After three strikes, we will talk about the possibility of reducing the individual's project grade by 5-10% or other penalties (if required) at the professor's discretion.

If a member is struggling to meet expectations but shows a willingness to improve, the group can propose an improvement plan:

Set Clear Expectations: The group will outline specific actions the member needs to take, including clearer deadlines, check-ins, or paired work to help them meet their tasks.
Follow-Up: The group will check in regularly with the member, ensuring progress and offering additional support if needed.
Reevaluation: If the member successfully meets the improvement plan's expectations, the issue will be considered resolved. If not, further escalation as outlined in Step 3 or Step 4 may be necessary.

## D. Roles for Members
>[!Note]
> General Member Responsibilities (Applicable to All Roles)
> All group members, regardless of the role they hold in a particular week, will be responsible for the following tasks:

>- Task Completion: Please complete assigned tasks by the agreed deadlines and inform the group of any obstacles or delays as soon as possible.
>- Preparation for Meetings: Come prepared for every meeting by reviewing prior discussions and tasks and contributing to the next steps in the research.
>- Peer Support: When necessary, support other team members in their roles and offer constructive feedback to improve the group’s overall performance.
>  Any changes required in responsibilities can be revised. 

Each group member will assume a role that will rotate weekly/biweekly to ensure accountability and equal participation. The roles will include a Leader, Historian, Timekeeper, and Devil’s Advocate. Below is an in-depth breakdown of what each role entails:

  Tasks include:
  1. Taking Detailed Notes: Record all relevant points, including task assignments, deadlines, and discussion summaries, during each meeting.
  2. Organizing Documentation: Maintain a centralized file (e.g., shared Google Drive, OneNote) where all meeting notes, project documents, and research data are stored. Ensure that all files are accessible and up-to-date.
  3. Summarizing Meetings: After each meeting, compile and send a summary to the group within 24 hours for reference and accountability.
  4. Assisting with Presentations: Help create and organize the slides or materials for presentations, ensuring they align with the group's research and discussions.

  3. Facilitating Problem-Solving: Facilitate thoughtful discussion of potential solutions or next steps to help the group make more well-rounded decisions.

Sub-Roles
Additional sub-roles (e.g., Research Analyst, Editor) may be introduced for specific tasks like data collection or document proofreading. These roles can be assigned based on the skill sets or availability of the group members.

## E. Communication Between Members

- All group members are expected to maintain clear and consistent communication through Imessage for updates and clarifications
- Urgent matters should be addressed via text or direct messaging, and group members must respond within 24 hours to avoid delays in decision-making or project progress
- For non-urgent queries or feedback, members are expected to provide thoughtful responses within 48 hours.
- All official group communications regarding task assignments, deadlines, and meeting agendas will be summarized in written form and shared with everyone for clarity and reference.
- If a member encounters an issue or conflict, they should raise it to the group in a respectful manner, either during the next meeting or via the group chat.

## F. Additional Protocols
- Fairness in Warnings: Before each warning is issued, the group should carefully consider whether the individual was given sufficient support or if other factors, such as workload distribution or personal challenges, may have contributed to their shortcomings.
- Continuous Review: Throughout the project, the group will regularly assess if any members are struggling with their tasks or deadlines, allowing for early interventions and providing support before escalation is necessary.
