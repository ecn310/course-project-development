## Methods for resolving an impasse
-  _Step 1_: All team members will hold each other accountable for tasks and we will have a designated person that will send out deadline reminders, so that no team member can say that they weren't aware of when to submit their work.
-  _Step 2_: All team members will have three strikes, if not communicated within 24 hours of the deadline, in terms of getting their work done on time.
- _Step 3_: If Step 1 is not met by all team members then the TA will be contcted and informed about the situation. 
- _Step 4_: If the individuals behavior does not change, the issue will be taken directly to Professor Buzard and a grade change will be determined.
