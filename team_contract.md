2. All group members will be punctual, and meetings will start 5 minutes after the designated time
3. Whenever a team member believes they cannot make it, they should make all efforts to let the team know 24 hours in advance, so the team can reschedule for the week
4. All team members will remain at the meeting until all issues have been discussed, work is complete, or there is unanimous agreement to end the meeting
5. Breaks will be decided unanimously during meetings. They should not exceed than 30 minutes

## B. Procedural

## C. Methods for Resolving an Impasse

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the following measures are fully enforceable by  Prof. Buzard and the class TA

-  __Step 1__: All team members will hold each other accountable for tasks and we will have a designated person that will send out deadline reminders, so that no team member can say that they weren't aware of when to submit their work.
-  __Step 2__: All team members will have three strikes, if not communicated within 24 hours of the deadline, in terms of getting their work done on time.
- __Step 3__: If Step 1 is not met by all team members then the TA will be contacted and informed about the situation. 
- __Step 4__: If the individual's behavior does not change, the issue will be taken directly to Professor Buzard and a grade change will be determined. 

## D. Roles for Members

If required a member may have to take on another role, e.g: Timekeeper and Devils Advocate. 

- Each week for every meeting the roles will keep changing for the team member creating accountability in everyone on the team.
        - Assigned prior to or before  meeting for the following week
- The leader will have an agenda planned out and have a set of rules that pertain to the academic research, and set-sub goals. Each sub-goal should be of group consensus. The leader is also responsible for presenting the group material to the class.
- The historian is responsible for taking notes during the meetings and organizing the recent files or communication files we may externally acquire prior to the initial research data, whilst making presentations from the same notes. 
The timekeeper keeps track of the time and has to keep track of the time allotted for each group. The leader is responsible for deciding the direction of the discussion when the time is running out.
- There will be an individual playing the devil's advocate and, hence would be required to keep his/her mind open to all discussions and points regarding problems, possibilities, and divergent or opposing ideas.

## E. Communication Between Members

- All group members are expected to maintain clear and consistent communication through Imessage for updates and clarifications
- Urgent matters should be addressed via text or direct messaging, and group members must respond within 24 hours to avoid delays in decision-making or project progress
- For non-urgent queries or feedback, members are expected to provide thoughtful responses within 48 hours.
- All official group communications regarding task assignments, deadlines, and meeting agendas will be summarized in written form and shared with everyone for clarity and reference.
- If a member encounters an issue or conflict, they should raise it to the group in a respectful manner, either during the next meeting or via the group chat.
