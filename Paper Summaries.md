Big picture question: How has manufacturing employment contributed to economic growth across different regions, and how has this contribution shifted in recent decades?

Hypothesis: While manufacturing has historically driven economic growth in developing countries, there is a growing divergence of manufacturing employment from economic growth, specifically in the face of globalization and the rise of the service sector in many regions.

Specific question:  How did the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain affect other countries, and how did they cope amidst colonialism?  
Hypothesis: Industrialization acts as an engine of growth in developing countries and there are no important examples of success in economic development in developing countries since 1950, which have not been driven by industrialization.

Big Picture Question: How does the Human Development Index specifically impact GDP growth in African countries between 1990 and 2015?

Specific Question: How have some African countries achieved a very high human development when controlling for inflation, capital, investment, labor, and foreign aid between 1990 and 2015?

Hypothesis: As the life expectancy increases in African nations, we can observe a rise in human development through the rise of GDP.
