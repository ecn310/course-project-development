Big picture question: How has manufacturing employment contributed to economic growth across different regions, and how has this contribution shifted in recent decades?

Hypothesis: While manufacturing has historically driven economic growth in developing countries, there is a growing divergence of manufacturing employment from economic growth, specifically in the face of globalization and the rise of the service sector in many regions.

Specific question: How did technological advancements during the Industrial Revolution boost industrial output and economic growth in nations like Britain, while leaving others like Japan and African countries behind? 

Hypothesis: How did technological advancements increase the scale of industrial production which in turn impacted economic growth?

Theory: With the start of the Industrial Revolution, most European countries embraced new technology, leading to more jobs and increased income. Britain, as the leading nation, saw a rise in per capita revenue, followed by other countries. Japan and many African nations were late to industrialize and are still catching up

_Big Picture Question_: How does the Human Development Index specifically impact GDP growth in African countries between 1990 and 2015?

_Specific Question_: How have some African countries achieved a very high human development when controlling for inflation, capital, investment, labor, and foreign aid between 1990 and 2015?

_Hypothesis_: As the life expectancy increases in African nations, we can observe a rise in human development through the rise of GDP.

_Theory_: The introduction argues that increased access to education, sanitation, and essential foods leads to higher life expectancy. As living standards improve, productivity at both the family and national levels rises due to income levels.

_Big Picture Question_: How does the new test procedure proposed in the article enhance the understanding of absolute convergence among countries, and why are standard unit root or cointegration tests with Bernard and Durlauf's definition of convergence considered inappropriate?

_Specific Question_: How does the new test procedure address inconsistencies in convergence testing among OECD countries, and what does it reveal about the economic performance of countries?

_Theory_: 

_Hypothesis_: Countries with lower initial per capita GDP are more likely to converge towards the group mean, while countries with higher initial per capita GDP may exhibit divergence from the economic leader (USA).
